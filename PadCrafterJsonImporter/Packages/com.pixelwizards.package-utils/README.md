==================
###NOTE: 

- this is a "fork" of the proper pixelwizards package @5b4922974d
- I modded the package definition class to be serialisable so I could make it into an asset & store multiple of them in my project :D
- see https://github.com/PixelWizards/com.pixelwizards.package-utils/issues/1 for details
